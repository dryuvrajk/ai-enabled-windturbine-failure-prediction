# The framework for wind turbine failure prediction
Machine learning applied to wind turbines incipient fault detection. This is a project part of my Master's degree.

There are a few publications that concerns this project. Some are published and some are in still in revision.
I'll post them out here as soon as they are released.

## Publications

The **main** publications about my dissertations is available at the paper entitle as [A reliable approach for detection of incipient faults of short-circuits in induction generators using machine learningâ˜†
](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045790618307584).

If you desire to use our dataset or replicate our methodology, I would appreacite if you could cite the paper. The bibtex is:
